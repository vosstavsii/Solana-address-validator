## Getting Started: Download or Build

Download a pre-compiled build or build the project yourself.

## Building the Project

Building the project from source guarantees the integrity of the code.

### Installing Dependencies Using vcpkg:

1.  Install **vcpkg** if you haven't already.
2.  Add vcpkg to your system PATH.
3.  Run:

    -   Install **OpenSSL**:
        ```bash
        vcpkg install openssl
        ```

    -   Install **nlohmann-json**:
        ```bash
        vcpkg install nlohmann-json
        ```

    -   Install **Crypto++**:
        ```bash
        vcpkg install cryptopp
        ```

    -   Install **libsodium**:
        ```bash
        vcpkg install libsodium
        ```

4.  Build the project.

### Building via Visual Studio:

1.  Open the project solution.
2.  Ensure **vcpkg** is correctly integrated.
3.  Click **Build** -> **Build Solution**.
4.  The executable is in the `bin` folder.

### Building with Another C++ Compiler:

1.  Ensure all dependencies are installed.
2.  Compile the project (example):

    ```bash
    g++ -o solanachecker main.cpp -lssl -lcrypto -lsodium -lcryptopp -std=c++17
    ```

## Command Line: Verifying Addresses

Utilize the command line:

1.  **-s / -search**: Start a brute-force search.
2.  **-t / -track (ADDRESS)**: Track an address.
3.  **-g / -gen (NUMBER)**: Generate wallets.
4.  **-m / -mnemonic (MNEMONIC)**: Show wallet data from a seed phrase.
5.  **-b / -balance (ADDRESS)**: *Use this command to validate a Solana address. If a balance can be retrieved, the address is likely valid.*
